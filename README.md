# RobloxScripts
A collection of my Roblox Lua scripting work. These are usually small files which can simply be imported to Roblox studio if you want to use them. I don't really need credit since I don't really associate myself with the platform anymore, but feel free to if you want.

HelsinkiCruisesStaffLock.lua - A small, basic stafflock, originally commissioned by Laatikkoxx in Helsinki Cruises.
